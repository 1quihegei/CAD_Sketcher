The book has received positive reviews from readers who praised its comprehensive coverage, rigorous approach, and understandable explanations. Some of the reviews are quoted below:

> "I followed this book during my Engineering undergraduate. The extent of topics covered is vast considering the volume of the book. However, never once does the reader feel that the topics have only been glanced upon. The book gives a very understandable mathematical description of the seemingly complicated solid mechanics formulae. The book also introduces in a very nice fashion the concept of tensors through stress and strain. Each word of this book is well written; not more not less. Else it would not have been able to cover so many topics in reasonable depth in so little volume. In short, the book truly is a masterpiece."[^4^]

> "thanks sir for writing a book that completely encompasses the true mathematical applications missing in numerous other indian books on the subject. Studied in 1st year"[^1^]

The book can be downloaded as a PDF file from various online sources, such as Scribd[^1^] [^2^] [^5^]. However, some of these sources may not be reliable or legal, and may contain errors or viruses. Therefore, it is recommended to purchase the book from a reputable publisher or seller, such as Tata McGraw-Hill[^4^], or access it from a library or an academic institution.
  
The book consists of 10 chapters, each covering a major topic of solid mechanics. The chapters are organized as follows:
 
- Chapter 1: Introduction. This chapter gives an overview of the scope and objectives of solid mechanics, and defines some basic concepts and terminology.
- Chapter 2: Analysis of Stress. This chapter introduces the concept of stress and its components, and explains how to calculate and represent stress in different coordinate systems.
- Chapter 3: Analysis of Strains. This chapter introduces the concept of strain and its components, and explains how to calculate and represent strain in different coordinate systems.
- Chapter 4: Stress-Strain Relations. This chapter establishes the relationship between stress and strain for different types of materials, such as elastic, plastic, and viscoelastic.
- Chapter 5: Uniaxial Deformations. This chapter analyzes the behavior of bars subjected to axial loads, and discusses the concepts of elastic limit, yield point, ultimate strength, fracture, and factor of safety.
- Chapter 6: Torsion Including Non-Circular Sections. This chapter analyzes the behavior of shafts subjected to torsional loads, and derives the formulas for shear stress and angle of twist for circular and non-circular sections.
- Chapter 7: Beams and Bending. This chapter analyzes the behavior of beams subjected to transverse loads, and derives the formulas for bending stress, shear stress, deflection, and slope for various types of beams and loadings.
- Chapter 8: Stability of Equilibrium Columns. This chapter analyzes the behavior of columns subjected to axial loads, and discusses the concepts of buckling, critical load, Euler's formula, and end conditions.
- Chapter 9: Combined Stresses. This chapter analyzes the behavior of members subjected to combined loads, such as axial, torsional, bending, and shear loads, and introduces the concepts of principal stresses, maximum shear stress, Mohr's circle, and failure theories.
- Chapter 10: Introduction to Energy Methods. This chapter introduces the concepts of work, energy, strain energy, potential energy, virtual work, and Castigliano's theorem, and applies them to solve problems in solid mechanics.

The book also contains numerous solved examples, exercises, figures, tables, and appendices to illustrate and reinforce the concepts and methods presented in the text. The book is suitable for self-study as well as classroom instruction.
